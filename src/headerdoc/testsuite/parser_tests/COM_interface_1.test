unsupported. Setting the callback value to nil defaults to synchronous execution.

obtained by calling GetGenerationAndNodeID()

"
        DISCUSSION: "<p>This function adds an event source for the isochronous callback dispatcher
to the specified CFRunLoop. Isochronous related callbacks will not be called unless
this function has been called. This function is similar to AddCallbackDispatcherToRunLoop. 
The passed CFRunLoop can be different from that passed to AddCallbackDispatcherToRunLoop.

"
        DISCUSSION: "<p>This function adds an event source for the isochronous callback dispatcher
to the specified CFRunLoop. Isochronous related callbacks will not be called unless
this function has been called. This function is similar to AddCallbackDispatcherToRunLoop. 
The passed CFRunLoop can be different from that passed to AddCallbackDispatcherToRunLoop.

        ABSTRACT: "<p>Seize control of device/unit
"
        DISCUSSION: "<p>Allows a user space client to seize control of an in-kernel service even if
that service has been Opened() by another client or in-kernel driver. This function should be
used with care. Admin rights are required to use this function.
</p>
<p>Calling this method makes it appear to all other drivers that the device has been unplugged.
Open() should be called after this method has been invoked.
</p>
<p>When access is complete, Close() and then IOServiceRequestProbe() should be called to restore 
normal operation. Calling IOServiceRequestProbe() makes it appear that the device has been "re-plugged."

	@param inRefCon A user specified reference value. This will be passed to all callback functions.
	@param inQueueBufferSize The size of the queue which receives packets from the bus before they are handed to
	the client and/or put in the backing store. A larger queue can help eliminate dropped packets
	when receiving large bursts of data. When a packet is received which can not fit into the queue, 
	the packet dropped callback will be called. 
	@param inBackingStore An optional block of allocated memory representing the contents of the address space.
	@param inFlags A UInt32 with bits set corresponding to the flags that should be set
	for this address space.
	&lt;ul&gt;

	using the contents of the backing store. The user process will not be notified of reads.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;kFWAddressSpaceAutoCopyOnWrite -- Writes to this address space will be made directly
	to the backing store at the same time the user process is notified of a write. Clients
	will only be notified of a write if kFWAddressSpaceAutoWriteReply is not set.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;kFWAddressSpaceShareIfExists -- Allows creation of this address space even if another client
	already has an address space at the requested address. All clients will be notified of writes to
	covered addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
